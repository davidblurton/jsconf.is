    h2 Why Are You Selling Tickets Before Speakers Are Announced And So Early?
    p Our conference dates are scheduled during a period of time that many individuals may be travelling or taking off, which historically may higher than normal travel costs. We are trying to allow JSConf attendees the ability to book their travel arrangements significantly in advance so as to take advantage of lower prices. We understand that the cost of a conference isn't just the price of the ticket, but also the hotel, travel, ticket, and other miscellaneous items as such we are doing our best to allow you the opportunity to make that as cost-effective as possible. We understand that some people might not be comfortable purchasing a ticket to a conference with little to no insight about what will be presented at the event. We apologize for any inconvenience or uncertainty this may cause you, but we are trying to balance the best of all worlds.
